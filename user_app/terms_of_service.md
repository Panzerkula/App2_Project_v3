Terms of Service:

The user's data is their own, however, if the user agrees to the Terms of Service and 
Data Privacy Policy, it may be used according to our Data Privacy Policy. The user may
request that their data be removed from our service or edited, and the user may request
to be given their data, according to the General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR). 
If the user's data is no longer in use, it will be deleted from our servers. The user's
consent to both the Terms of Service and Data Privacy Policy is required to use this
application. Retraction of consent is done by deleting your account. On deletion,
all collected information from the user will thus also be deleted from our servers.

Data Privacy Policy:

The data that our service collects is limited to Username, Password and Email. Username
and password is collected for the sole purpose of letting the application function
properly (I.E. to grant users access to their own games, and prevent others from
accessing another user's game). The Email is collected for the purpose of letting the user
recover their account if the user has forgotten the password, and to verify the accounts
owner if it is compromised. No data will be collected without the user's consent, and
consent may be given upon account creation. If for any reason the Data Privacy Policy or
the Terms of Service should change, the user will have to consent to the changes before
continuing to use the application.
